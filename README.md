Functionality
This application is aimed at capturing peoples contact information, so whoever is running this application can later spam them for future marketing offers on their hypothetical (and at this time unknown) product.

There are two pecularliar aspects of this application:

Anyone can add their own contact information, or some one else's contact information!
Anyone can view all of the contact information added to the site!
Anyone can register to the site, login, and edit anyone's contact information!
This is (hopefully) very clearly a strange application, and a gigantic privacy catastrophe, but we will pretend it's reasonable.
